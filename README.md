# ECSE429-Project

This is our ECSE429 Software Validation Project, Part A Unit Test Suite

### Assignment of Unit Tests
- Categories: Sophia
- Projects: Ida
- Todo: Ivan
- Interoperability: Amy

- Some of the intercapability relationship endpoints were tested by our respective capability modules.

### Tips to Run

- Prerequisites: Maven

- If test run fails due to connection issue, run application using `java -jar runTodoManagerRestAPI-1.5.5.jar` and retry

- Helpful to use `@BeforeAll` method in JUnit to ensure the server is responding before tests start

- Run `mvn test` on terminal in root (where pom.xml is)
